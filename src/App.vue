     <p>Lorazepam, sold under the brand name Ativan among others, is a benzodiazepine medication.[3] It is used to treat anxiety disorders, trouble sleeping, severe agitation, active seizures including status epilepticus, alcohol withdrawal, and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.[3] It is also used during surgery to interfere with memory formation and to sedate those who are being mechanically ventilated.[3][7] It is also used, along with other treatments, for acute coronary syndrome due to cocaine use.[3] It can be given by mouth or as an injection into a muscle or vein.[3] When given by injection onset of effects is between one and thirty minutes and effects last for up to a day.[3]

Common side effects include weakness, sleepiness, low blood pressure, and a decreased effort to breathe.[3] When given intravenously the person should be closely monitored.[3] Among those who are depressed there may be an increased risk of suicide.[3][8] With long-term use, larger doses may be required for the same effect.[3] Physical dependence and psychological dependence may also occur.[3] If stopped suddenly after long-term use, benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may occur.[3] Older people more often develop adverse effects.[9] In this age group lorazepam is associated with falls and hip fractures.[10] Due to these concerns, lorazepam use is generally only recommended for up to two to four weeks.[11]

Lorazepam was initially patented in 1963 and went on sale in the United States in 1977.[12][13] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[14] It is available as a generic medication.[3] In 2018, it was the 58th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13 million prescriptions.</p>
